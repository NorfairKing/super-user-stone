The configurations deployer that turns any computer into your computer.

Have you ever been frustrated that you had to put all your configuration files in place again after reinstalling your operating system?
If you forgot to even make back-ups of your configuration files you even had to remake al those configuration files.
Well, that was the last time you face such a problem, thanks to the Super User Stone.

SUS manages the deployment of your config files and aids you in speeding up the process of reinstalling your linux operating system.

** Usage
There are two main ways to use SUS.
 - Along with dropbox.
 - Along with a backup of your config files.
Note, these are not the only ways.
*** The dropbox way
    The user keeps a folder of all its config files in their dropbox.
    When SUS is deployed, it makes symbolic links from that folder to the correct places.
    This way, if any config file is changed, the changes are synces across systems.
    SUS supports shared config files and host-specific config files
